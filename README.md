# Pokemon Sprite Downloading and Augmenting
## Made by Mateusz Kolinski MateuszPKolinski@gmail.com

Pokemon sprite images are downloaded from https://pokemondb.net/sprites
Only generation 3, 4, 5 and 6 Pokemon sprites are selected. Older and newer sprites have very different art styles.

After downloading, sprites are augmented (hue and saturation changes, then mirror image) and finally converted to 32-bit images for use in neural networks.

Example of the process:
